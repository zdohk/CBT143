+   The 'safe' compress is recommended since it backs up     +PANEL  - IDCAMLSH
+   the PDS first to a file named 'your.dsn.XX'.
+
+   However, if you can recover from other sources (e.g. FDR), then the 'fast'
+   compress is probably adequate.
+
+   The JOB CLASS option determines what run class your batch compress will
+   run in.
+
+   The JOB OUTPUT PARMS option sets the parms in a JOB level OUTPUT statement
+   which routes all output with the designated parms.
